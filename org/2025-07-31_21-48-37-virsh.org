Virsh is a command-line interface (CLI) utility used for managing virtual machines (VMs) and other virtualization components, interacting with them through the [[id:d7aebff6-4d3e-4575-91af-d20d3da6dfbe][Libvirt]] virtualization API. It allows users to create, manage, and control virtual machines, as well as interact with storage pools and networks within a virtualization environment.
