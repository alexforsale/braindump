* Defining Enum
Where /structs/ give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like a =Rectangle= with its width and height, /enums/ give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to say that =Rectangle= is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes =Circle= and =Triangle=. To do this, [[id:b0c3a713-8b46-4f98-857d-7145ced06d68][Rust]] allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.
