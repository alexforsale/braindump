=eglot= ([[id:e7f4a9c9-3d0d-40dc-94b9-349c59525166][Emacs]] General Language-aware Operations Tool) is a built-in LSP client for Emacs.

It connects Emacs to a language server to provide modern IDE features, such as:
-   Code completion
-   Go to definition/references
-   On-the-fly diagnostics (errors/warnings) via Flymake
-   Documentation on hover

=eglot= is designed to be lightweight and integrate with standard Emacs features. It has been included with Emacs since version 29.
