fd is a program written in [[id:b0c3a713-8b46-4f98-857d-7145ced06d68][Rust]] to find entries in your filesystem. It is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find. While it does not aim to support all of find's powerful functionality, it provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for a majority of use cases.
