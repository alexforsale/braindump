ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool written in [[id:b0c3a713-8b46-4f98-857d-7145ced06d68][Rust]], that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files. (To disable all automatic filtering by default, use ~rg -uuu~.) ripgrep has first class support on [[id:0607e7ee-1c11-4cd0-910b-b65f36b21f84][Windows]], macOS and [[id:65db4594-b7ec-463b-9e97-64d080e44c12][Linux]], with binary downloads available for every release. ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack and grep.
