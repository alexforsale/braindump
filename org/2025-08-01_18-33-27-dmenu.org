dmenu is a fast and lightweight dynamic menu for [[id:3ce7a6a5-ae8b-4e02-9959-9b3e8d9705ac][X]]. It reads arbitrary text from stdin, and creates a menu with one item for each line. The user can then select an item, through the arrow keys or typing a part of the name, and the line is printed to stdout. dmenu_run is a wrapper that ships with the dmenu distribution that allows its use as an application launcher.
