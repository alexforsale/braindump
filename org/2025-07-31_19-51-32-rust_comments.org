* Comments
All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave comments in their source code that the compiler will ignore but people reading the source code may find useful.

#+begin_src rust
  // hello, world
#+end_src

In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and the comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that extend beyond a single line, you’ll need to include =//= on each line, like this:

#+begin_src rust
  // So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
  // multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
  // explain what's going on.
#+end_src

Or you can use the multi-line comment syntax with =/*= and =*/=:

#+begin_src rust
  /* So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
     multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
     explain what’s going on. */

#+end_src
