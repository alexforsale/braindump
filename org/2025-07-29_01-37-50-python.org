#+title: python
Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It is known for its clear and readable syntax, which emphasizes code readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance.

Key characteristics of Python:
* Interpreted
Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, without the need for a separate compilation step. This speeds up the development process, as changes can be tested immediately.
* High-level
Python abstracts away low-level details of computer hardware, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving rather than managing memory or system resources.
* General-purpose
Python is not specialized for any particular type of application and can be used for a wide range of tasks.
* Object-oriented
Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms, allowing for modular and reusable code through the use of classes and objects.
* Extensive standard library and ecosystem
Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules for various functionalities, and a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks are available through the Python Package Index (PyPI).
* Cross-platform
Python runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Beginner-friendly
Its simple and intuitive syntax, along with abundant learning resources, makes Python a popular choice for beginners in programming.
